The Niederreiter sequence with non-singular upper triangular generating matrices

We provide the irreducible polynomials and direction numbers for generating the Niederreiter sequence with non-singular upper triangular generating matrices (in base 2).

Our files can be used by replacing the files of Sobol' sequences provided by Joe and Kuo:
